- Kameda, K., <strong>Lu, Z.</strong>, Fukui, M., 2025. Fiscal Sentiment and Long-Term Interest Rates.
  - **Abstract**: This study re-examines how fiscal foresight affects long-term interest rates, addressing identification challenges of low data frequency and arbitrary fiscal event selection. Using NLP (Natural Language Processing) on 126,908 daily newspaper articles, we construct a fiscal sentiment index, capturing unexpected fiscal changes. Regression analysis finds (1) fiscal sentiment significantly influences long-term interest rates, (2) QQE suppresses market responses to fiscal deterioration, and (3) sentiment-driven rate fluctuations reflect bond market conditions, while credit risks dominate during major policy shifts. These findings, robust to various specifications and instrumental variable estimation, offer insights into interest rate dynamics, including recent US and UK cases.
