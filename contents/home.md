Hello and welcome to my personal website! 

I am a specially-appointed assistant professor (AP) at Kansai Gakuin University, currently serving in the Department of School of Policy Studies. 

My academic career is dedicated to macroeconomic research, with a primary focus on analyzing the macro impacts of fiscal policy. I am passionate about understanding how government fiscal decisions influence labor market and cyclical movements of the economy.

Beyond my research, I have a strong interest in programming, which enables me to explore wider range of research areas. Additionally, I am a food enthusiast who loves discovering and appreciating diverse culinary experiences.
